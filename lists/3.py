# In the third task we have two lists again, filled with random numbers. Our
# job is to complete the first list with all the numbers present in the second
# list but not in the first one, and vice versa, add to the second list all
# the numbers that can be found in the first one but not in the second. In the
# end, display the two lists in increasing order, which will make it easier to
# check if we got the same list twice.
