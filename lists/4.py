# In the fourth task we have to decide if the elements of a list are in
# increasing order. In the solution we assume that they are sorted, then we
# compare the pairs of numbers, and if there is any pair where the smaller
# value has a greater index in the list, then the list is not sorted.

list = [43, 70, 25, 39, 15, 85, 42, 94, 11, 76, 20,  36, 48]
