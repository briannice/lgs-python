# The students have probably already heard about the Fibonacci sequence where
# the next number is always the sum of the two previous ones. The first two
# elements are 0 and 1, so we have to calculate the elements from #3. Fill a
# list with the first 100 Fibonacci numbers, and print the last one on the
# screen.

a_1 = 0
a_2 = 1
series = [a_1, a_2]
